			<h1>Welcome to the JobbyLobby API</h1>
			<p>This API serves most of the requests to the JobbyLobby app!<br />
			We use the <a href="http://open.canada.ca">Open Canada Datasets</a> for a lot of our data... but we also use data sets from
			various other sources including job sites such as <a href="http://indeed.ca">Indeed</a> and <a href="http://monster.ca">Monster</a></p>
			<p><strong>With this API, we are helping students find better jobs by expanding their horizons and giving them access to other cities which may better serve their job positions.</strong></p>
